  Code Style Guidelines:
    Use clear, concise comments to explain any complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

    Follow standard Bash scripting conventions:
      Indent code consistently.
      Use lowercase variable names where possible and descriptive variable names for clarity.
      Avoid hardcoding paths or values; use variables to make the script adaptable.
    Prefer printf over echo for output, as it’s more portable across different systems.
    Use #!/bin/bash at the beginning of the script to specify the shell interpreter.
